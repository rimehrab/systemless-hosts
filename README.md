# **Systemless Hosts Module**  
A required module to use applications like AdAway on APatch, KernelSU, etc.

## **Common Issues & Fixes**  
If apps, such as banking, fail to work properly, detect root, consider installing a different module. This module only mounts the host file and does not contain any code for hiding root
